* adjustable difficulty of the AI

*The game will be structured similar to Super Mario where it is possible if you jump on the opponent to take him out

*The enemies will be androids which reflects the AI

*different types of enemies, some of them will shoot back or be faster or endure more

*Depending on the difficulty, the tactical movement and thinking of the opponents changes

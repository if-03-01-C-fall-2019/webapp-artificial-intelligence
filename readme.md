We planned to do a jump and run where you can adjust the difficulty of the AI.
The game will be structured similar to Super Mario where it is possible if you jump on the opponent to take him out.
The enemies will be androids that the AI ​​reflects.
There will be different types of enemies, some of them will shoot back or be faster or endure more.
Depending on the difficulty, the tactical movement and thinking of the opponents changes.
There will be powerups and the most difficult difficulty level will be powerdowns.
It will be possible to access the game on the website and the game will be compatible for PC and mobile phones.
5 levels are planned for the beginning and a boss fight for the last level.

    <h2>What is AI?</h2>
    <section class="b">
      <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) simulates human intelligence with machines, especially computer systems. This includes learning (the collection of information and rules for using the information), the conclusion (using the rules to draw approximate or definitive conclusions) and self-correction. Special applications of AI are expert systems, speech recognition and machine vision.
The term artificial intelligence (AI) was invented by John McCarthy, an American computer scientist, at the Dartmouth Conference in 1956. Today, AI is a generic term that ranges from robotic process automation (RPA) to actual robotics.
Artificial intelligence has become increasingly important recently, in part due to Big Data and the increase in the speed, size, and variety of data that companies collect today. For example, AI can recognize patterns in data more efficiently than humans, giving companies more insight into their data.
There are two types of AI’s.
The first type is the weak AI. This is an AI system that is developed and trained for a specific task. Virtual personal assistants, like Siri from Apple, are a form of weak AI. The second type is the strong AI. The strong AI, also known as general artificial intelligence, is an AI system with generalized human cognitive skills so that when it get faced with an unknown task, it has enough intelligence to find a solution. The Turing test, developed Alan Turing in 1950, is a method to determine whether a computer can think like a human, but the method is controversial.

        <h3>1950 TURING TEST</h3>
        <p>Computer scientist Alan Turing proposes a test for machine intelligence.
           If a machine can trick humans into thinking it is human, then it has
           intelligence. He thought that at year 2000 the average user has a 70%
           Chance to identify if it is a human or a machine. His prediction was
           incorrect.</p>

           <p>Aibo is an entertainment robot developed by the Japanese electronics
              company Sony as a toy. With the Aibo, Sony pioneered the introduction of
              robots into households. A total of more than 150,000 Aibos were sold.
              Aibo perceives information about its surroundings using a camera,
              microphones and, to a limited extent, tactile feedback. This information
              is processed in an internal computer. The output of this computer
              consists of an imitation of typical dog behavior, such as four-legged
              gait, non-verbal communication through movement of the ears and tail,
              rolling on the floor, etc. In addition, there is a sound or speech output
              and LEDs that directly display the simulated “mood” of the device.

        <p>Siri is software from Apple that is used to recognize, and process
          naturally spoken language and is intended to perform the functions of a
          personal assistant. Siri runs on Apple's operating systems iOS, macOS,
          watchOS and tvOS. At the end of 2016, Apple's servers processed around 2
          billion Siri requests per week. Siri was initially only available on the
          iPhone 4s under iOS 5. With iOS 6, the assistant was also usable on iPads
          of the 3rd generation and newer, the iPhone 5 and finally the iPad mini
          and the iPod touch of the 5th generation. On September 9, 2014, the first
          Apple Watch with Siri support was announced. Exactly one year later, the
          4th generation Apple TV was released, which also supports Siri. With the
          release of macOS Sierra, the voice assistant also found its way into the
          personal computer product lines.</p>

        <h3>2011 WATSON</h3>
        <p>IBM’s question answering computer Watson wins first place on popular $1M
           prize television quiz show Jeopardy. To demonstrate its capabilities, the
           program competed in three episodes of the quiz show Jeopardy! with two
           human opponents who had previously won record sums on the show. The game,
           for which a million-dollar prize was awarded, was therefore compared in
           the media with the duel of chess world champion Garri Kasparov against
           the computer Deep Blue.The system won the game with a final score of
           $ 77,147 over the $ 24,000 and $ 21,600 of its human rivals.In
           January 2017, a Japanese insurance company replaced more than 30
           employees with the Watson platform.The AI should check the names and
           data of the insured as well as their medical history and assess injuries.</p>

        <h3>2014 EUGENE</h3>
        <p>Eugene Goostman is a chatbot that has been developed since 2001. To make
           him believable for chat partners, he imitated the personality of a
           13-year-old Ukrainian boy. At a Royal Society event in London organized
           by Kevin Warwick, Eugene Goostman managed to convince 33 percent of his
           human chat partners that he was a human being and not a computer.
           Warwick then explained that the bot had passed the Turing test.
           This conclusion was discussed controversially, partly due to the
           experimental setup.</p>

        <p>Tay was a Microsoft-developed artificial intelligence chatbot that
           went public on March 23, 2016 via Twitter. It subsequently caused
           public controversy when the bot started writing offensive tweets,
           forcing Microsoft to shut down the service just 16 hours after it
           started.Tay was developed by Microsoft with the goal of testing how
           artificial intelligence can learn in everyday life. According to
           Microsoft, Tay should be concerned with people and entertained. The
           bot should also be able to create user profiles and thus personalize
           communication.</p>

    <h2> AI Today</h2>
    <section class="b rounded_top">
      <p>Anyone who has recently read about artificial intelligence will quickly
        get a bizarre impression: Today or tomorrow at the latest, we will be
        dealing with autonomously acting and thinking machines - be it threatening
        killer drones on the one hand or salvation-enhancing surgical robots on
        the other. And the production robots will make many of our jobs obsolete.
        Not to forget the artificial intelligence, which outweighs our actions
        in real and digital life, sometimes more or less precisely, and draws
        conclusions and predictions from them.</p>
    </section>

      <section class="w">
        <h3>Tool Box AI</h3>
        <p>In practice, people who research with artificial intelligence have at
           most a tired smile for these scenarios. They are about as far from
           reality as a weekend trip to the next solar system.
           Today, artificial intelligence can be compared to a well-equipped
           toolbox. Just as there are screwdrivers, pipe wrenches or hammers for
           screwing, loosening or striking applications, there are data
           interpretation using AI route search engines for Google Maps, web
           search engines like Bing or image classification machines like
           Clarifai. And - in order to further weave the analogy - just as one
           does various activities in building a home
           (e.g. building something or tearing it down) and requires associated
           special tools and materials, there are also fundamentally different
           types of activities (e.g. classifying or marking) and materials in the
           area of ​​artificial intelligence - mostly in the form of data or
           data-producing sensors.</p>

    <section class="b rounded_bottom">
      <h3>Save Life with AI</h3>
       <p>A specific AI activity is, for example, making forecasts and possible
          courses based on structured data. An example from medicine: If a
          patient suffers from a slowly falling, then suddenly rapidly rising
          fever after an infection, an artificial intelligence, taking into
          account other factors, can decide to raise the alarm immediately before
          the next regular human control - and save valuable hours.
          All data streams and signals in this context can be clearly
          differentiated from one another and are thus structured. All that is
          required is a constant monitoring of relevant signals, as well as a
          classification machine that learns to differentiate between dangerous
          and regular situations and can assess different situations better and
          better through continuous use.This does not replace regular inspection
          tours and therefore does not replace human responsibility in the
          hospital. But AI can provide meaningful support for staff and save one
          or two lives.</p>
